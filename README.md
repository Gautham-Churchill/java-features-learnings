## Interfaces in Java 8
**We can define methods in interface in Java 8.**<br>
We can use default and static methods in an interface to define a method

## Date & Time API in Java 8
* Until Java 7 `Date` class was used from `java.util.time` package which was confusing with `java.util.sql` package
* In Java 8 it is changed to `java.time` package

* Pass a method as a parameter to another method
* We can create custom method reference similar to `System.out::println`
